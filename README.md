# MONSFA

v1.6 add problem class for storing functions


v1.5 add Crowing Distance (NSGA-II version)  
     update makefile

v1.4 fix ZDT6 dimension (ZDT6 needs high iteration to convergence)  
     in different setting of (non-dominated set)  
     figure (FUNC_NUM)-(non-dominated set)-(ITERATION)

v1.3 ZDT6 (TODO)

v1.2 fix dominated  
     change Crowding Distance Selection

v1.1 test function  
     real time gnuplot

v1.0 a feasible version for Schaffer function N.1 (SCH)

v0.7 Crowding Distance Selection

v0.6 fix NAN bug

v0.5 before Crowding Distance Selection

v0.4 {I} for move equation

v0.3 (DONE) fast non-dominated sorting

v0.2 before the non-dominated fitness

v0.1 FA -> MONSFA

//TODO 

moving case 2 in paper

{I} calculate method

{D} for Box-Muller

class Population
